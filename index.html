      <h2 id="optical-character-recognition-ocr-with-2-partners">Optical character recognition (OCR) <em>(with 2
          partners)</em></h2>
      <h3 id="february---may-2021">February - May 2021</h3>
      <p>Our project aims to develop such a tool that takes an image as the input and extracts characters (letters,
        digits, symbols) from it. The Image can be of a text in a real-world environment, such as street signs or
        Printed documents.</p>
      <p>Optical character recognition (OCR) plays an important role in transforming printed materials into digital text
        files (hard copies into soft copies). These digital files can be very helpful to kids and adults who have
        trouble reading. That’s because digital text can be used with software programs that support reading in a
        variety of ways. Moreover, taking a picture of a text and using OCR to scan it and then translate it could be
        helpful when dealing with foreign languages.</p>
      <p>Therefore to achieve our goal, we used 5167 (90%) pictures for training and 574 (10%) for validation from the
        <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth">Synthetic Word Dataset</a> which consists of 9
        million images covering 90k English words. This is synthetically generated dataset which we</p>
      <p>found sufficient for training text recognition on real-world images. We used a CRNN model that is composed of
        different kinds of network architectures (CNN and RNN) and that is jointly trained with a CTC loss function.</p>
      <h2 id="password-file-management-tool">Password File Management tool</h2>
      <h3 id="may-2021">May 2021</h3>
      <p>Python Script with a graphical interface using Tkinter and is an AES encrypted password manager that is
        intended to safely store passwords. They are encrypted with a master password and saved locally in an SQLite
        database after being encrypted using AES. The Master password is set by the user after verifying that the
        passwords are inputted correctly and not weak. The hash of the master password (SHA 512) and the hint if one was
        provided are then in a text file to be used for login later. This project adds on the simple feature that makes
        importing files from the outside (google chrome) much easier to the user in which importing such passwords saved
        on google is one click away and is easy as it gets.</p>
      <p>The password manager uses AES encryption to save passwords to the database and is saved locally for maximum
        security. It has many features including providing random passwords, import and exporting passwords. It has most
        of the major required features together with simplicity.</p>
