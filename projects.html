<h2 id="text-recognition-on-containersvessels">Text Recognition on Containers/Vessels</h2>
<h3 id="cma-cgm-•-august-2020">CMA CGM • August 2020</h3>
<p>Text Recognition on Container/Vessel, with extra features such as web mining to get container information from the container number or voyage information from voyage reference (the container number, vessel name, voyage history, and location).<br>
Python libraries and technologies used for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIL, pylab, NumPy, and OpenCV for image manipulation.</li>
<li>EasyOCR for text recognition.</li>
<li>Selenium for web mining.</li>
<li>Tkinter for the GUI interface.</li>
</ul>

<li>Register with a phone number (OTP).</li>
<li>Create a profile with a name, picture, and status.</li>
<li>Display the contacts of the phone that use the app.</li>
<li>Send and receive text, images, audios, videos, documents, and other files.</li>
<li>Send and receive voice notes and emojis.</li>
<li>See if a user is online, typing and the last seen.</li>
<li>See if a message was sent and if it was read.</li>
<li>Unsend messages.</li>

<h2 id="mobile-application-to-connect-users-with-local-professionals-with-2-partners">Mobile Application to connect users with local professionals <em>(with 2 partners)</em></h2>
<h3 id="september-2020---may-2021">September 2020 - May 2021</h3>
<p>An application that connects users with local professionals such as home services (cleaning services, home maintenance), DJ, photographers, personal trainers, and much more. it will support people who have vocational skills like electric, painter, or carpenter and connect them with those who are in need for such services. Our application also allows people to post job vacancies so that users can make use of our app to find jobs in certain places online.</p>
<h2 id="optical-character-recognition-ocr-with-2-partners">Optical character recognition (OCR) <em>(with 2 partners)</em></h2>
<h3 id="february---may-2021">February - May 2021</h3>
<p>Our project aims to develop such a tool that takes an image as the input and extracts characters (letters, digits, symbols) from it. The Image can be of a text in a real-world environment, such as street signs or Printed documents.<br>
Optical character recognition (OCR) plays an important role in transforming printed materials into digital text files (hard copies into soft copies). These digital files can be very helpful to kids and adults who have trouble reading. That’s because digital text can be used with software programs that support reading in a variety of ways. Moreover, taking a picture of a text and using OCR to scan it and then translate it could be helpful when dealing with foreign languages.<br>
Therefore to achieve our goal, we used 5167 (90%) pictures for training and 574 (10%) for validation from the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth">Synthetic Word Dataset</a> which consists of 9 million images covering 90k English words. This is synthetically generated dataset which we<br>
found sufficient for training text recognition on real-world images. We used a CRNN model that is composed of different kinds of network architectures (CNN and RNN) and that is jointly trained with a CTC loss function.</p>
<h2 id="password-file-management-tool">Password File Management tool</h2>
<h3 id="may-2021">May 2021</h3>
<p>Python Script with a graphical interface using Tkinter and is an AES encrypted password manager that is intended to safely store passwords. They are encrypted with a master password and saved locally in an SQLite database after being encrypted using AES. The Master password is set by the user after verifying that the passwords are inputted correctly and not weak. The hash of the master password (SHA 512) and the hint if one was provided are then in a text file to be used for login later. This project adds on the simple feature that makes importing files from the outside (google chrome) much easier to the user in which importing such passwords saved on google is one click away and is easy as it gets.<br>
The password manager uses AES encryption to save passwords to the database and is saved locally for maximum security. It has many features including providing random passwords, import and exporting passwords. It has most of the major required features together with simplicity.</p>
